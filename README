This version of patch contains modifications made by the Free Software
Foundation, summarized in the file ChangeLog.  They add support for:
 * handling arbitrary binary data
 * the unified context diff format that GNU diff can produce
 * making GNU Emacs-style backup files
 * improved interaction with RCS and SCCS
 * the GNU conventions for option parsing and configuring and compilation.
They also fix some bugs.

Tutorial-style documentation for patch is included in the GNU
diffutils package.

The FSF is distributing this version of patch independently because as
of this writing, Larry Wall has not released a new version of patch
since mid-1988.  I have heard that he has been too busy working on
other things, like Perl.

Please send bug reports for this version of patch to
bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu as well as to Larry Wall (lwall@netlabs.com).

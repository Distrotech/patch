          <p>This is GNU patch, which applies diff files to original files.</p>

<p>This version of patch has many changes made by the Free Software Foundation.
They add support for:</p>

<ul>
<li>handling arbitrary binary data and large files</li>
<li>the unified context diff format that GNU diff can produce</li>
<li>merging into files instead of creating reject files</li>
<li>making GNU Emacs-style backup files</li>
<li>improved interaction with RCS and SCCS</li>
<li>the GNU conventions for option parsing and configuring and compilation.</li>
<li>better POSIX compliance
They also fix some bugs.</li>
</ul><p>If you obtained this file as part of a "git clone", then see the
README-hacking file.  If this file came to you as part of a tar archive,
then see the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.</p>

<p>See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.
A more detailed descripiton of all changes can be found in the file ChangeLog
in tar archives, and with "git log" which shows the version control history.</p>

<p>Tutorial-style documentation for patch is included in the GNU
Diffutils package; get GNU Diffutils 2.8 or later for up-to-date
documentation for patch.</p>

<p>Use `configure --disable-largefile' to disable large file support;
this is reportedly necessary on Red Hat GNU/Linux 6.0 to avoid a C library bug.
For MS-DOS using DJGPP tools, see the file pc/djgpp/README.
For other systems, copy config.hin to config.h and change</p>

<p>The Free Software Foundation is distributing this version of patch
independently because as of this writing, Larry Wall has not released a
new version of patch since mid-1988.  We have heard that he has been
too busy working on other things, like Perl.  He has graciously agreed
to let GNU `patch' be distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License.</p>

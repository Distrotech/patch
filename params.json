{"name":"Patch","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.sv.gnu.org/patch.git","body":"This is GNU patch, which applies diff files to original files.\r\n\r\nThis version of patch has many changes made by the Free Software Foundation.\r\nThey add support for:\r\n * handling arbitrary binary data and large files\r\n * the unified context diff format that GNU diff can produce\r\n * merging into files instead of creating reject files\r\n * making GNU Emacs-style backup files\r\n * improved interaction with RCS and SCCS\r\n * the GNU conventions for option parsing and configuring and compilation.\r\n * better POSIX compliance\r\nThey also fix some bugs.\r\n\r\nIf you obtained this file as part of a \"git clone\", then see the\r\nREADME-hacking file.  If this file came to you as part of a tar archive,\r\nthen see the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.\r\n\r\nSee the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.\r\nA more detailed descripiton of all changes can be found in the file ChangeLog\r\nin tar archives, and with \"git log\" which shows the version control history.\r\n\r\nTutorial-style documentation for patch is included in the GNU\r\nDiffutils package; get GNU Diffutils 2.8 or later for up-to-date\r\ndocumentation for patch.\r\n\r\nUse `configure --disable-largefile' to disable large file support;\r\nthis is reportedly necessary on Red Hat GNU/Linux 6.0 to avoid a C library bug.\r\nFor MS-DOS using DJGPP tools, see the file pc/djgpp/README.\r\nFor other systems, copy config.hin to config.h and change\r\n#undef statements in it to #define as appropriate for your system,\r\nand copy Makefile.in to Makefile and set the variables that are\r\nenclosed in @ signs as appropriate for your system.\r\n\r\nPlease send bug reports for this version of patch to\r\n<bug-patch@gnu.org>.\r\n\r\nThe Free Software Foundation is distributing this version of patch\r\nindependently because as of this writing, Larry Wall has not released a\r\nnew version of patch since mid-1988.  We have heard that he has been\r\ntoo busy working on other things, like Perl.
